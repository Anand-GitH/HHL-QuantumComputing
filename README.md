Linear System Equations Solver using Quantum Computing (HLL Algorithm)
Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations
Aram W. Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, Seth Lloyd

Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as 
a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector b, find a vector x such that Ax=b

We use Amazon Braket language to implement this algorithm.
